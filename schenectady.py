you pitchpoled away from me,
head first and over,
smacked down to the rail slag
slickened with sputtering rain,

i watched you tumble to your feet,
through a jarring whim of physics
and stare blankly after me,
stunned blind in shrill tympanies
of concussive shock,
your stop motion panic framed with garlands
of matted blood-
innocent to the brutalities of gravel,

hours ago we had traced together
ellipses of fearlessness,
astride the deck of a tanker car,
sailing with constellations
waltzing across spitfire darknesses,
into the brave face of dawn,
just like the rails I had promised you,

but twenty hours riding suicide,
on a double stack through the rain,
will make your mind numb with foolish mercies,
and you know i can’t ride through states,
where i’ve got outstanding warrants,

i taught you to run with the train,
and where to jump as best i could,
and squeezed your hand to tell you it’s alright,
fucking hell i wanted to keep you safe,
but the union pacific,
she is a vengeful god,

when i clung helpless to the car,
fifty tons of American cruelty
spinning beside my head and i watched you
get swallowed by the hillside and vanish
behind a boxcar in the bend, 
i’m so sorry god your face asking me
i don’t understand and i smother you
with gauze and tears and rain and i love you
in the soot smeared smile of it’s ok,
it’s ok.\n'''
